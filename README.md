marionette-skeleton
===================

Starting point for backbone/marionette projects with require.js.

- Uses Marionette.js to extend the tools Backbone.js gives you.
- Modules are handled using require.js (AMD).
- This skeleton follows an mvc-ish file structure and expects you to split up all components into modules
- You may want to use r.js (requirejs optimizer) to package modules and their dependencies together to minimize the number of requests. (Modularity in development is a good thing but requesting 100's of files in a large application may not be so much)

Using it
--------

js/requiremain.js
- Dependencies
- App.start()

More usage details coming soon...
